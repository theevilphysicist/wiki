# Translating

Create a directory in here using your language's [ISO_639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) code. So for German, create a directory named `de`.

Then, replicate the _exact same structure_ as the Wiki English content but in your language. So inside `de` you'd have `meta`, `scripting`, `server` and `tutorials`.

Thank you for contributing translations!
